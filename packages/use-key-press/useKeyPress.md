# `useKeyPress` Hook

The `useKeyPress` hook is an advanced utility for detecting specific keypress events in React applications. It supports customizable debounce timing and can listen for keypress events either globally or locally within a component.

## Features

- **Key Detection:** Monitors for the press of a specific key.
- **Debounce Support:** Includes an optional debounce feature to manage rapid keypresses.
- **Global and Local Listening:** Option to listen for keypress events globally (across the entire window) or locally (within a specific component).
- **SSR Compatibility:** Safely handles server-side rendering environments.

## Installation

To integrate `useKeyPress` into your project:

```bash
npm install @custom-react-hooks/use-key-press
```

or

```bash
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/use-key-press
```

## Usage

```typescript
import useKeyPress from '@custom-react-hooks/use-key-press';

const TestComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const enterPressed = useKeyPress('Enter');

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Press the "Enter" key</p>
      {enterPressed && <p>You are pressing the "Enter" key!</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TestComponent;
```

This example demonstrates using `useKeyPress` to detect when the Enter key is pressed with a debounce of 200 milliseconds.

## API Reference
