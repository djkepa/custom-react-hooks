# useAsync Hook

The `useAsync` hook simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations in React applications, such as data fetching or any other promise-returning functions. It provides a structured way to track the status and outcome of async operations.

## Features

- **Automated Execution:** Optionally executes the async function automatically on component mount.
- **Manual Execution:** Provides a function to manually trigger the async operation.
- **Status and Error Tracking:** Tracks the status of the async operation and captures any errors.
- **SSR Compatibility:** Safe for server-side rendering, with checks to prevent automatic execution on the server.
- **Value Management:** Manages the value returned from the async operation.

## Installation

Choose and install individual hooks that suit your project needs, or install the entire collection for a full suite of utilities.

### Installing Only Current Hooks

```bash
npm install @custom-react-hooks/use-async
```

```bash
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/use-async
```

### Installing All Hooks

```sh
npm install @custom-react-hooks/all
```

or

```sh
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/all
```

## Usage

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useAsync } from '@custom-react-hooks/all';

const fetchData = async (endpoint) => {
  const response = await fetch(endpoint);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch from ${endpoint}`);
  }
  return response.json();
};

const AsyncComponent = () => {
  const [endpoint, setEndpoint] = useState('');
  const [simulateError, setSimulateError] = useState(false);
  const { execute, status, value: data, error } = useAsync(() => fetchData(endpoint), false);

  const handleFetch = () => {
    if (simulateError) {
      setEndpoint('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    }
    execute();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={endpoint}
        onChange={(e) => setEndpoint(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter API endpoint"
      />
      <button onClick={handleFetch}>Fetch Data</button>
      <div>
        <label>
          <input

# useClickOutside Hook 

The `useClickOutside` hook is designed to detect and handle clicks outside of a specified element or set of elements. This is particularly useful for closing modal windows, dropdowns, and other components when a user interacts outside of them.

## Features

- **Element Focus Management:** Detects clicks outside of the specified element(s), which is essential for managing the focus and closing modal windows, dropdowns, and other components.
- **Customizable Event Listening:** Listens for specific events like `mousedown` and `touchstart` to determine outside clicks, with the option to customize the events.
- **Dynamic Detection Control:** Provides the ability to enable or disable the click outside detection dynamically, which offers flexible integration with various UI state requirements.
- **Ref Exclusion:** Allows for the exclusion of certain elements (by refs) from triggering the outside click logic, which is useful when certain elements within the component should not close it.
- **Multiple Element Support:** Can handle multiple elements as an array of refs, which is great for complex components that may consist of disjointed elements.
- **Simple Integration:** Easy to integrate into existing components with minimal changes required to the existing structure.

## Installation

Choose and install individual hooks that suit your project needs, or install the entire collection for a full suite of utilities.

### Installing Only Current Hooks

```bash
npm install @custom-react-hooks/use-click-outside
```

or

```bash
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/use-click-outside
```

### Installing All Hooks

```sh
npm install @custom-react-hooks/all
```

or

```sh
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/all
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `useClickOutside` hook in a modal component:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { useClickOutside } from '@custom-react-hooks/all';

const Modal = ({ onClose }) => {
  const modalRef = useRef(null);

  useClickOutside(modalRef, onClose);

  return (
    <div ref={modalRef}>
      <p>Modal content goes here</p>
      <button onClick={onClose}>Close Modal</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const ClickOutsideComponent = () => {
  const [isModalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const openModal = () => setModalOpen(true);
  const closeModal = () => setModalOpen(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={openModal}>Open Modal</button>
      {isModalOpen && <Modal onClose={closeModal} />}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ClickOutsideComponent;
```

In the above example, clicking outside the `<div>` containing the modal content will trigger the `onClose` function.

## API Reference

### Parameters

- `refs` (RefObject | RefObject[]): A ref or an array of refs to the element(s) you want to detect outside clicks on.
- `callback` (function): A callback function that will be called when a click outside the detected elements occurs.
- `events` (string[], optional): An array of event names to listen for clicks. Defaults to `['mousedown', 'touchstart']`.
- `enableDetection` (boolean, optional): A boolean to enable or disable click detection. Defaults to `true`.
- `ignoreRefs` (RefObject[], optional): An array of ref objects for elements that, when clicked, should not trigger the callback.

## Use Cases

- **Closing Modals or Popups**: Automatically close a modal or popup when a user clicks outside of it.
- **Dropdown Menus**: Collapse dropdown menus when the user interacts with other parts of the application.
- **Context Menus**: Hide context menus or custom right-click menus when clicking elsewhere on the page.
- **Form Validation or Submission**: Trigger form validation or submission when clicking outside of a form area.
- **Toggling UI Elements**: Toggle the visibility of UI elements like sidebars or tooltips when clicking outside of them.

## Notes

- Ensure the elements referenced by `refs` are mounted when the hook is called.
- The hook must be called within a functional component body or another custom hook.

        placeholder="Type here..."
      />
      <p>Debounced Value: {debouncedValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DebounceComponent;
```

In this component, the search function is debounced, which means it will only execute 500 milliseconds after the user stops typing.

# useLockBodyScroll Hook

`useLockBodyScroll` is a React hook for controlling the scroll behavior of the body element in web applications. It's particularly useful for scenarios like opening modals or overlays where background scroll needs to be disabled.

## Features

- **Conditional Scroll Lock:** Allows you to conditionally enable or disable the body scroll.
- **Style Preservation:** Preserves the original body overflow style and restores it upon unmounting.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Compatibility:** Safe for use in SSR environments by checking for the `document` object.
- **Synchronous Execution:** Uses `useLayoutEffect` for synchronous updates to the DOM.

## Installation

### Installing Only Current Hooks

```bash
npm install @custom-react-hooks/use-lock-body-scroll
```

or

```bash
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/use-lock-body-scroll
```

### Installing All Hooks

```sh
npm install @custom-react-hooks/all
```

or

```sh
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/all
```

## Usage

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useLockBodyScroll } from '@custom-react-hooks/all';

const LockBodyScrollComponent= () => {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
  useLockBodyScroll(isModalOpen);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{isModalOpen ? 'Scroll hidden' : 'When you click on the button scroll will be hidden'}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {isModalOpen && (
        <div className="modal">
          <div>
            <p>Modal Content</p>
            <button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}>Close Modal</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LockBodyScrollComponent;
```

In this example, the hook is used to lock the body scroll when the modal is open.

## API Reference

- `lock`: A boolean indicating whether to lock (`true`) or unlock (`false`) the body scroll.

## Use Cases

1. **Modals and Popups**: This is the most common use case. When a modal or popup is opened, it's often desirable to lock the background content to prevent the user from scrolling. This keeps the focus on the modal content.

2. **Full-Screen Menus**: In mobile-responsive designs or certain desktop layouts, when a full-screen menu is opened, you might want to lock the scroll to keep the user's focus on the navigation options.

3. **Onboarding Flows or Guided Tours**: If your application has a step-by-step onboarding process or a guided tour, you might want to lock scrolling to ensure the user follows the flow without distractions.

4. **Image or Video Galleries**: When a user clicks on an image or video to view it in a larger format (like a lightbox), locking the scroll can enhance the viewing experience by removing background distractions.

5. **Infinite Scroll Prevention**: In some scenarios, you might want to temporarily disable infinite scrolling features. For example, when a user performs an action that requires attention or confirmation, you could lock the scroll to keep them focused on the task.

6. **Interactive Games or Quizzes**: If you're embedding games or quizzes in your web application, you might want to lock the background scroll when these elements are in focus to enhance user engagement and prevent accidental scroll-offs.

7. **Alerts or Critical Notifications**: When displaying critical alerts or notifications that require immediate attention or action, disabling the background scroll can ensure that the user addresses these alerts without distraction.

8. **Complex Forms or Surveys**: In a long, multi-step form or survey, you may want to lock the scroll when displaying validation errors or important information to ensure the user sees and acknowledges these messages.

- **Responsive Design Support:** Facilitates the development of responsive components.
- **Debounced Resize Events:** Limits the frequency of resize event handling to improve performance.
- **SSR Compatibility:** Safely handles scenarios where the `window` object is not available, such as server-side rendering.

## Installation

### Installing Only Current Hooks

```bash
npm install @custom-react-hooks/use-window-size
```

or

```bash
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/use-window-size
```

### Installing All Hooks

```sh
npm install @custom-react-hooks/all
```

or

```sh
yarn add @custom-react-hooks/all
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { useWindowSize } from '@custom-react-hooks/all';

const WindowSizeComponent = () => {
  const { width, height } = useWindowSize(100);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Current Window Size:</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Width: <span>{width}</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Height: <span>{height}</span>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
export default WindowSizeComponent;
```

In this example, the `useWindowSize` hook is used to track the size of the browser window. The debounce delay is set to 200 milliseconds to optimize performance.

## API Reference

### Parameters
- `debounceDelay`: (optional) The delay in milliseconds for debouncing the resize event.

### Returns
  - `width`: The current width of the window.
  - `height`: The current height of the window.


## Use Cases

- **Responsive Components**: Create components that respond to changes in window size.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Adjust layout dynamically based on the window size, enhancing responsiveness.
- **Visibility Control**: Show or hide elements based on the available viewport size.
- **Size-Dependent Functionality**: Implement functionality that depends on the size of the window, like different navigation styles for mobile and desktop.
