# Contributing to React Custom Hooks

We welcome contributions to the React Custom Hooks library! Here's how you can contribute:

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/djkepa/custom-react-hooks.git
   cd custom-react-hooks
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Link your local package for development:**

   If you are developing a specific hook (e.g., `use-window-size`), navigate to the package's directory and use `npm link` to symlink the package for local development:

   ```
   cd packages/use-window-size
   npm link
   ```

## Running Tests

1. **Run tests with Jest:**

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will run tests for all hooks. To test a specific hook, you can use:

   ```
   npm test -- packages/use-window-size
   ```

## Formatting Code

We follow a consistent coding style, and we encourage you to use code formatters like Prettier:

```
npx prettier --write .
```
